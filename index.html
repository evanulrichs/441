                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I am currently a senior in the media arts program at the University of Montana. 
                I am expected to graduate at the end of the summer of this year. I have experience in many applications found
                in the Adobe suite such as Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, and Premier Pro. I am a team member on the KPGN
                group found on campus, where I do graphic design, motion design, and video editing work. I also work 
                with cameras and lighting equipment for clients.</p>

                <p>In my spare time I enjoy many different shows and movies. Animated content has always been my media of choice ever 
                since I was a kid. Adventure Time and Helluva Boss are a couple of my favorites. I also really like to play video games. 
                I particularily enjoy single-player action adventures such as Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Nier: Automata. 
                I also play a lot of Dungeons and Dragons. It's a great way to flex your creative muscles in a collaberative 
                environment and its a ton of fun.
