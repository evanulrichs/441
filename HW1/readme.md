441 HW-1 Readme

I had a number of issues while working on this assignment. To start, getting Github operational took quite a bit of time. I was initially confused about how to set up Github as well as its purpose, as it seemed to make the entire process of editing my site harder and more complicated. My site now exists in two places instead of one, and if I want to change it I have to ask permission from a middle man and wait for it to load, which could take upwards of 10 minutes. It got to the point where I had to download an extension in my scriptwriting software that would demo my code on a local server. I am so glad I did this, as I could see the results of my tinkering immediately. 

Considering it has been a while since I last used HTML and CSS, actually getting the site to do and look how I wanted took a lot of time. I frequently found myself on w3schools.com, looking at their examples to get me back into it. I am also grateful for Professor Cassensâ€™ example site, as a lot of the formatting on my site was based on that. It also helped jog my memory in terms of how formatting in HTML and CSS works, as well as how to get the two languages to work together.
