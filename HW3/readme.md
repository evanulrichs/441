The most difficult part of this assignment was honestly just planning and writing all of the places the user could go. I got a little carried 
away with writing this whole thing but I think it turned out pretty cute. I also had issues getting the images to change when I wanted them to. This was because I was not using 
the "src" tag in my javascript. Overall I am happy with the project and I hope you have fun playing it.
