This project took me a bit of time. I mostly had problems with getting the website to keep track of how much money was left and what items were in the cart. 
I also had to consider what would happen if the user tried to put values that exceeded the budget or if they used a negative number. The purchase function took a but if tweeking
as well as it sometimes caused the site to not progress to the next part when you hit submit. Overall I got it to work and I'm happy with the result.
