        This is Jimothy the mouse. He is going grocery shopping but forgot his list! Guess he'll have to impovise.
        Jimothy has a budget of 20$ (he is a college student). Should he go to the bakery first? 
        Or maybe the produce section? Theres also dairy and a small sweets section too. Where to go first?
